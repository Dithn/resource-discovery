# Specific Aim

The mission of the CD2H Resource Discovery Core is to support discovery of the rich landscape of expertise and resources available within the CTSA hubs and beyond, and to provide a robust infrastructure for supporting attribution of the diverse types of contributions needed to perform translational team science.

# Research Strategy
We leverage effective strategies and inventive approaches to build
connections within and beyond the CTSA Consortium. We have adapted and expanded our existing research profiling
infrastructure using open collaborative approaches . We are developing tools to identify, track, disseminate, and
understand the contribution and impact of software, data, informatics, and other non-traditional scholarly
products and activities to properly attribute credit. Finally, this extended knowledge about expertise across the
CTSAs is being applied to assist in the creation and success of community-wide collaborative functions. This
mission is manifest in activities such as:
* Provisioning a CTSA-wide index of all resource types utilized across the full spectrum of CD2H
activities;
* Creation of expertise visualizations and services for adoption and assimilation by CTSA hubs for use in
their local environments;
* Customization and deployment of an open repository system for CTSA Consortium artfacts;
* Harmonization of educational resources from multiple existing platforms into a single shared discovery framework;
* Extending representation of expertise and related services across the CTSA consortium;
* Developing a practical, scalable model of contribution and fostering its adoption across the CTSA
consortium;
* Extending institutional adoption of research profiling platforms in a platform-agnostic manner.
