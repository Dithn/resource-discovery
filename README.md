# Specific Aim

The mission of the CD2H Resource Discovery Core is to support discovery of the rich landscape of expertise and resources available within the CTSA hubs and beyond, and to provide a robust infrastructure for supporting attribution of the diverse types of contributions needed to perform translational team science.

# Research Strategy
We leverage effective strategies and inventive approaches to build
connections within and beyond the CTSA Consortium. We have adapted and expanded our existing research profiling
infrastructure using open collaborative approaches . We are developing tools to identify, track, disseminate, and
understand the contribution and impact of software, data, informatics, and other non-traditional scholarly
products and activities to properly attribute credit. Finally, this extended knowledge about expertise across the
CTSAs is being applied to assist in the creation and success of community-wide collaborative functions. This
mission is manifest in activities such as:
* Provisioning a CTSA-wide index of all resource types utilized across the full spectrum of CD2H
activities;
* Creation of expertise visualizations and services for adoption and assimilation by CTSA hubs for use in
their local environments;
* Customization and deployment of an open repository system for CTSA Consortium artfacts;
* Harmonization of educational resources from multiple existing platforms into a single shared discovery framework;
* Extending representation of expertise and related services across the CTSA consortium;
* Developing a practical, scalable model of contribution and fostering its adoption across the CTSA
consortium;
* Extending institutional adoption of research profiling platforms in a platform-agnostic manner.

## Significance
CTSA hubs experience serious challenges in maintaining awareness of existing resources, resulting in significant duplication of effort and lost opportunities for synergy. An effective discovery platform spanning the spectrum of expertise, services and resources holds great promise to change this.

## Innovation
We have developed an open, flexible architecture of resource identification, characterization and discovery based open open tools and able to be extended with new capabilities as needs are identified.

### Justification and Feasibility
While first identified as a core component of our proposal to create CD2H, we have received recurring comments regarding a need for such a capability from NCATS personnel, CTSA hub PIs, CTSA informatics directors, and the CTSA Consortium population in general.

Feasiblity has already been demonstrated with our proof-of-concept faceted search interface (see below).

### Summary of existing system and findings
See CD2H Labs (labs.cd2h.org) for our latest demonstration platforms. These include:
* the CD2H project dashboard
* CD2H faceted search
* a prototype of a CTSA Consortium-specific web harvesting and extraction platform (used for service characterizations so far)
* a platform for harvesting and search of CTSA-relevant GitHub repositories, owners and contributors
* a VIVO-compatible plaform integrating traditional research profiling data with GitHub information and connections to "grey" sources such as FigShare

## Approach
The approach we have taken to date has been one of rapid prototyping of a harvesting platform for a newly identified information source, integration of the resulting metadata into the SciTS warehouse and then enabling discovery of those metadata in our faceted search engine. We plan on continuing this approach as long as new information sources arise.

In year 3, we will be enhancing this overall framework with multiple means (JDBC, GraphQL, SPARQL) for hubs to directly interrogate the environment and embed both services and information into their local environments.

### Progress Report
As noted above, we have made significant progress in configuring SciTS as a central resource linking the various activities and tools in this core. This has been greatly informed by our engagement with the CTSA community - particulary in the areas of educational resources, services and characterization of the roles assumed by CTSA personnel (see the Personas project for more information on this). We have multiple live services operational in CD2H Labs with frequent deliverables scheduled in the coming reporting period.
