# Specific Aim

The mission of the CD2H Resource Discovery Core is to support
discovery of the rich landscape of expertise available within the CTSAs and beyond, and to provide a robust
infrastructure for supporting attribution of the diverse types of contributions needed to perform translational
team science.

# Research Strategy
To achieve this, we will leverage effective strategies and inventive approaches to build
connections within and beyond the CTSA Consortium. We will adapt and expand our existing research profiling
infrastructure using open collaborative approaches . We will develop tools to identify, track, disseminate, and
understand the contribution and impact of software, data, informatics, and other non-traditional scholarly
products and activities to properly attribute credit. Finally, this extended knowledge about expertise across the
CTSAs will be applied to assist in the creation and success of community-wide collaborative functions. This
mission will be manifest in activities such as:
* Extending representation of expertise and related services across the CTSA consortium;
* Extending institutional adoption of research profiling platforms in a platform-agnostic manner;
* Developing a practical, scalable model of contribution and fostering its adoption across the CTSA
consortium;
* Provisioning a CTSA-wide UBER index of all resource types utilized across the full spectrum of CD2H
activities;
* Creation of expertise visualizations and services for adoption and assimilation by CTSA hubs for use in
their local environments.
